Aura Component that displays the recently viewed object


Create an Aura component that displays a record of the Account, Contact, or Opportunity objects (whichever record is the most recently viewed of the three). This component should use the compact layout to determine the fields included in the display. The component should be surfaced on a Lightning home page. (Hint: the RecentlyViewed object may be helpful).
